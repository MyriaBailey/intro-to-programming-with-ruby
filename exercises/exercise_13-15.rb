# Exercise 13
# Use Ruby's Array method delete_if and String method start_with? to delete all of the strings that begin with an "s" in the following array.

arr = ['snow', 'winter', 'ice', 'slippery', 'salted roads', 'white trees']

arr.delete_if { |string| string.start_with?('s', 'w') }

puts arr


# Exercise 14
# Take the following array:
a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']
# and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. 
# (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. 
# Look into using Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.

one_word_arr = a.map { |string| string.split }.flatten
puts one_word_arr


# Exercise 15
# What will the following program output?
hash1 = {shoes: "nike", "hat" => "adidas", :hoodie => true}
hash2 = {"hat" => "adidas", :shoes => "nike", hoodie: true}

if hash1 == hash2
  puts "These hashes are the same!"
else
  puts "These hashes are not the same!"
end

# They are the same, since order does not matter and both syntax usages are equivalent
