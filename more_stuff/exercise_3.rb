# Exercise 3
# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

=begin
Exception handling is where you anticipate an exception being possibly raised somewhere
(often as a result of improper user input)
and write an alternative action to take in the event that things go wrong.
Typically uses begin/rescue/end as reserved keywords,
though you can use just rescue for an inline exception
=end
